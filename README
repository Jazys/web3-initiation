#To install hardhat tools and create project


#Create moonbeam node

In order to create your node on internet (no buy ou swap coin, only transfer and call contract)

```use docker-compose -f docker-compose-with-traefik up -d```

It deploy a blockchain node and nginx server to make test.
All example of html file are in webpage directory

Note: when you purge your node (restart for example), you need to clear all transaction from account in metamask

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl git
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs
```

to create a project and directory :

```
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai
npm install web3
npx hardhat (and select empty project)
```

Moombean node provide you 10 ten accounts for testing.
Install Node moombean for developpement (with docker) :

```
version: '3'
services:
  polkadot:
    image: purestake/moonbeam:v0.18.1
    ports:
      - "30333:30333"
      - "9933:9933"
      - "9944:9944"
    command: --dev --rpc-external --ws-external
```

The accounts_moombean contains all account with public adress and private key

Copy paste this config and change IP according to your moombean installation docker dev :

```
// ethers plugin required to interact with the contract
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers');

// private key from the pre-funded Moonbase Alpha testing account
const { privateKey } = require('./secrets.json');

module.exports = {
  // latest Solidity version
  solidity: "0.8.1",

  networks: {
    moonbase: {
      url: 'http://185.189.157.205:9933',
      chainId: 1281, // 0x507 in hex,
      accounts: [privateKey]
    }
  }
};
```

You need to have a secrets json file that contains one private key on a pre-configured account offer by moombean dev

Create your contract (see directory)

Compile your contract :

```
npx hardhat compile
```

# To deploy the contract :

```
npx hardhat run --network moonbase scripts/deployXXX.js
